Decentralized Web Application (DApp) Project

## Module Information

Module Code: SC6106

Module Title: Blockchain Development
Fundamentals (Part 1)

Instructor: Teoh Teik Toe

Weightage: Part of 50% Course Project

## 1. Assignment Overview

Students will work in groups (4–6 members)
to design and present a decentralized web application (DApp). This project
evaluates your understanding of blockchain fundamentals, Ethereum, smart
contracts, security considerations, and Web3 DApp architecture.

## 2. Deliverables

1. 10-minute video recording link
2. 20-slide PowerPoint presentation (PDF or
   PPTX)
3. GitHub repository (optional but
   encouraged)
4. Short written summary (500–800 words)

## 3. Project Theme

Develop a decentralized application (DApp)
under any real-world use case. Examples include decentralized voting, supply
chain tracing, NFT mini-marketplace, crowdfunding, or certificate verification.

## 4. Requirements

A. Smart Contract (Mandatory):

- Written in Solidity
- 2–3 main functions
- Use events, modifiers, mappings, require
  checks
- Include security considerations

B. Architecture:

- Frontend mockup (React/HTML acceptable)
- Interaction via Web3 wallet
- Deployment or demo via Remix

C. Presentation:

- Maximum 20 slides
- Clear explanation of problem,
  architecture, contract logic, demo, limitations

D. Written Summary:

500–800 words addressing problem
background, blockchain rationale, design decisions, security analysis,
limitations, and future improvements.
